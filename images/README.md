# PWA Icons and Images

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add the following image files to the `images/` folder:

1. `favicon.ico` - 16x16 or 32x32 favicon
2. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 PWA icon
3. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 PWA icon
4. `logo.png` - Company logo for structured data

You can generate these using online tools like:

For the logo, use your company branding.
